```{r}
library("knitr")
opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, warning = FALSE)
read_chunk("cca_sim.R")
```

```{r, packages}
```

```{r, opts}
```

This generates data according to the standard poisson likelihood
formulation. See for example "On Model Formulation in Constrained
Ordination Analysis" by Zhu and Hastie.

```{r, generate-data}
```

We can plot the simulated data, and some of the parameters that went
into it.

```{r, plot-data-sim}
```

We can apply the usual canonical correspondence analysis from `vegan`.

```{r, apply-cca}
```

And we can inspect the scores in relation to the simulation setup.

```{r, evaluate-scores}
```

As a point of reference, we can also run canonical correlations on the
two matrices (log transforming the counts).

```{r, cancor}
```
